This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_46/) manually implements the Backpropagation method to iteratively adjust the weights of the connections between neurons in a neural network classification model. The Gradient Descent algorithm was similarly applied to minimize the difference between the predicted and the actual target responses using a range of values for the learning rate and epoch count parameters. The cost function optimization and classification accuracy profiles of the different candidate parameter settings were compared during epoch training. The class distributions of the resulting predictions were visually evaluated against the target response categories.
